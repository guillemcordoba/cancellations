# Setting up the zomes

> This guide assumes you are inside a nix develop environment with `hc scaffold` available.

1. Scaffold a new zome pair named `cancellations` with:

```bash
hc scaffold zome cancellations
```

Select the "Integrity/coordinator zome pair" option, and accept the path that the scaffolding tool offers to scaffold the zomes.

2. Add the `hc_zome_profiles_coordinator` and `hc_zome_profiles_integrity` zomes as dependencies with:

```bash
cargo add -p cancellations hc_zome_cancellations_coordinator
cargo add -p cancellations_integrity hc_zome_cancellations_integrity
```

3. Go into the newly scaffolded integrity zome's `lib.rs` (its path may be similar to `dnas/lobby/zomes/integrity/cancellations/src/lib.rs`) and **replace its contents with**:

```rust
extern crate hc_zome_cancellations_integrity;
```

4. Go into the newly scaffolded coordinator zome's `lib.rs` (its path may be similar to `dnas/lobby/zomes/coordinator/cancellations/src/lib.rs`) and **replace its contents with**:

```rust
extern crate hc_zome_cancellations_coordinator;
```
